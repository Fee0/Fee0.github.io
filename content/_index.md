Hello!

I love security, Rust, and all low-level things :-)

# _Feynman Technique_

I'm writing this blog to learn and organize ideas in my brain more clearly using the [_Feynman Technique_](https://fs.blog/feynman-technique/):

1. Pretend to teach a topic to a child (or write it down)
2. Identify knowledge gaps and fill them
3. Refine and simplify
4. Repeat until you can explain a topic in simple terms
