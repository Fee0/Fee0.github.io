Hello!
I'm Frederik Peukert, a software engineer in Stuttgart, Germany.

I love security, Rust, and all low-level things :-)

# _Feynman Technique_

I'm using this blog to learn and organize things in my brain more clearly using the _Feynman Technique_ named after the famous physician [Richard Feynman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Feynman):

1. Pretend to teach a topic to a child (or write it down)
2. Identify knowledge gaps and fill them
3. Refine and simplify
4. Repeat until you can explain a topic in simple terms
